Name: WFIGS NIFC Fire Perimeter and Fireline Processing and QAQC
Author: Alex Arkowitz @ Colorado State University - alexander.arkowitz@colostate.edu
Date Created: 02/13/2023

Limitations:
Compatible with Python 3.x and ArcGIS Pro environments only which can be a limitation if the script is used in different versions of the software where the tools may have been updated or deprecated.
Assumes input datasets follow standard NIFC schemas.
The script is designed for National Interagency Fire Center specific fire-related datasets, limiting its applicability to other types of spatial analyses without significant modification
There may be hardcoded paths and URLs, which may change over time, thus requiring manual updates to the script.
The processing power required and the need for a stable internet connection also play a role in the tool's performance and capabilities.

Usage: To be used when firelines are needed from NIFC Operations data. Visual inspection and other QAQC will need to be done on the output.

Description:
This Python script is designed to work within the ArcGIS environment, specifically leveraging the arcpy library to manipulate and analyze geospatial data related to fire perimeters and operational data.
The script contains multiple sections, each dedicated to a particular step in the process of preparing, analyzing, and refining fire-related datasets.

Initially, the script sets up the environment, defining input parameters and variables to store data paths and URLs to external data sources.
Functions are defined to report errors and download data, such as historical fire perimeters and operational data based on the year of fire incidents.
The script handles downloading, unzipping, and processing data files from specified URLs, ensuring they're in the correct format and location for subsequent analysis.
Using the variables provided, the QAQC tool downloads the selected operations data for the (calendar year) CY from NIFS public data.

Subsequent sections of the code focus on preprocessing the data, including projecting datasets to a standard coordinate system (GCS_WGS_1984), repairing geometry, and calculating geodesic areas.
A significant portion of the script is dedicated to quality control: it compares attributes between different datasets to ensure consistency in naming and identification numbers (IRWIN IDs).
Since the perimeters have two IRWIN ID fields, if the attr_irwin ID is null and the poly_irwinID is not null, the attr_irwinID that are null are taken from the populated poly_irwinIDs.
If the attr_incidentnames and attr_irwin IDs for both the firelines and the perimeters have any extra spaces found before and after the text, it will be removed.
The ops line data is then filtered to only contain: 'Completed Burnout', 'Completed Dozer Line', 'Completed Fuel Break', 'Completed Hand Line', 'Completed Mixed Construction Line',
'Completed Plow Line', 'Completed Road as Line', 'Contained Line', and 'Road as Completed Line'.
The ops line is again filtered based on the “delete this” field to delete 'Yes - Editing Mistake', 'Yes - No Longer Needed') Or FeatureStatus IN ('Proposed') Or FeatureStatus IS NULL"
The ops data IRWIN ID field is analyzed to look for missing {} brackets around the IRWIN ID. If it does not start with a “{“ then those are inserted around the IRWIN ID.
The ops data IRWIN ID field is then analyzed for length. If 'CHAR_LENGTH("IRWINID") < 36 OR CHAR_LENGTH("IRWINID") > 40' it is considered invalid as they are always (as of 2023) within that threshold.
This removes comments such as “Don’t know”, “?” ect.
The script identifies and corrects discrepancies between the fire perimeter and fireline data by considering attributes such as the incident name and the point of origin state.
This process includes buffering fire perimeters to capture nearby firelines that may not have matching attributes but are spatially related to the fire events.
The ops data line type is then analyzed and is attributed a rank as follows:
if FeatureCategory =='Completed Road as Line':  return 1
    elif FeatureCategory =='Road as Completed Line': return 1
    elif FeatureCategory =='Completed Dozer Line': return 2
    elif FeatureCategory =='Completed Hand Line': return 3
    elif FeatureCategory =='Completed Mixed Construction Line': return 4
    elif FeatureCategory =='Completed Fuel Break': return 5
    elif FeatureCategory =='Completed Burnout': return 6
    elif FeatureCategory =='Completed Plow Line': return 7
    elif FeatureCategory is None: return None
The data is then projected to GCS WGS 1984, and the geometry is repaired. Null geometry features are deleted.
A field is added to the perimeter dataset to calculate geodesic acreage.

The script addresses data integrity by removing duplicates based on attributes like shape, incident name, line type, and IRWIN ID, and by dissolving overlapping features.
The next section compares IRWIN IDs, Incident name, and POO (point of Orig) of perimeters and firelines to grab all lines outside of buffer area (done later) if they have
the same IRWIN ID and/or the same incident name within the same POO state.
The perimeter data is then brought into the scratch workspace as a copy since query tables require both datasets to be in the same gdb. 
The Ops data is intersected with a US States polygon and joined to the perimeter attributes to ID if the firelines:
    "Has Matching IRWIN and Name"
    "Has Matching IRWIN ID. Name Taken From Matching IRWIN"
    "Has Matching Inc Name in Same State. IRWIN Taken From Matching Name"
The fields are then populated accordingly. If a name or IRWIN ID was already present and overwritten, the overwritten records are stored in fields “OldName” and “OldIRWIN” accordingly.

A subset of firelines is then created that was not IDed as part of the fire due to attribution.
A buffer is created around the user input fire perimeter and all intersecting firelines are selected.
The “Flag” field is then populated accordingly:
        if (IncidentName is None and IRWINID is None): "Within Buffer but Both Inc Name and IRWIN Null. Both Changed to Match Largest Perim"
        elif (IRWINID is None and IncidentName is not None): "Within Buffer but IRWIN Null. Both Changed to Match Largest Perim"
        elif (IRWINID is not None and IncidentName is None): "Within Buffer but Inc Name Null. Both Changed to Match Largest Perim"
        elif (IRWINID is not None and IncidentName is not None): "Within Buffer but Both Inc Name and IRWIN Didnt Match. Both Changed to Match Largest Perim"
If these fields did have attribution, the “OldName” and “OldIRWIN” were populated accordingly.
Finally, the script concludes with metadata writing to the output feature classes, importing predefined metadata templates to document the datasets' sources, processing history, and other relevant information.

The final output is a set of processed, consistent, and clean geospatial datasets ready for further analysis or reporting on fire incidents and operations.
